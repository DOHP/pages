<div><span>D.O.H.P. is the entity conceived by the most advanced computer technology the world has ever known: the human mind. Its province represents man's nature to both destroy and create, and is the irony of his existence. It is also the essence of our own universe; organized chaos that simultaneously spreads light and casts darkness in the same instance; creating peace through the divine while perpetuating death through acts of war.</span></div>
<div>It has been put forth onto earthly materials using man-made technology as means to:</div>
<div>1) Change Conventional Wisdom</div>
<div>2) Preserve &amp; Maintain the Universal Dichotomy between the Spiritual &amp; Physical Worlds</div>
<div>3) Manifest the Intangible</div>
<div>All of this is done in the name of steadfast progression down the path of a future unknown, a future unwritten...D.O.H.P.!?</div>
