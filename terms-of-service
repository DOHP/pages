<p>If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:</p>
<p>1. You and Digitally Organic Hybrid Products agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Service or your use thereof, including these Terms of Service or other Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Digitally Organic Hybrid Products are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service and the termination of your Digitally Organic Hybrid Products account. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by these Terms of Service, and as administered by the AAA. You and Digitally Organic Hybrid Products agree that these Terms of Service involve interstate commerce and are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. Furthermore, you agree that any dispute, claim or controversy with an amount of $75,000.00 or less shall be determined by one arbitrator, and the parties shall submit written evidence to the arbitrator without a hearing.</p>
<p>2. YOU AND Digitally Organic Hybrid Products AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any other person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>
<p>3. Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must bee asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Rules with the remainder to be paid by Digitally Organic Hybrid Products.</p>
