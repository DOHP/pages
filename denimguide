<p><span>If the denim fits tight, it fits right. Upon trying denim on, it will be well fitted. Give it 10 minutes, walk around, sit down; this breaks your new denim in as they conform to your body. True to size.</span></p>
<p><span> </span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> For robust or athletic thighs, you may need to go up a size. For the best <em>experience</em> before placing an order, contact us for a personal fitting consultation. Follow return procedures if the size/fit you received is not working after performing the 10-minute break-in process.</span></p>

<p><span> </span><span>Personalize your denim through the personality of your daily journey. The more you wear without washing, the better story your denim tells. We highly recommend four to six months of constant wear without washing for the best results in the character of your denim.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>D.O.H.P. Denim Tip:</span></em></strong><em><span> If you decide to wash your denim prior to the character building (too early), the indigo will just bleed out evenly over the whole pair and you will not have any unique contrast.</span></em></p>
